# Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for a conference paper **"Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks"** that we wrote. This paper gives an introduction to the advantages of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Cell in a Recurrent Neural Network and uses it to predict the outcome of a football match.

## Dataset 

The dataset used here has been obtained from [football-data.co.uk](http://football-data.co.uk/data.php). Datasets of the English Premier league have been taken from seasons 2010-11 to 2016-17.
