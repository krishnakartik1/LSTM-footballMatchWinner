# Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for a conference paper "Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks" that we wrote. This paper gives an introduction to the advantages of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Cell in a Recurrent Neural Network and uses it to predict the outcome of a football match.
